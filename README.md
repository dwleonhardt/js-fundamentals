## Welcome to JavaScript!!

There's so much to do!  Let's get started.

## Objectives

By the time you complete these challenges, you should be able to:

- Write basic JavaScript statements and expressions
- Use online documentation to help solve problems using JavaScript

## Setup

First, you need to get this code onto your machine.  To do so, clone this repository.

PROTIP: Make sure you use the SSH URL

At the command line run:

```
cd ~/workspace
git clone git@github.com:gSchool/javascript-statements.git
cd javascript-statements
atom .
open index.html
```

You'll see a page that looks like this:

Locate the area that shows how many tests are passing, and how many are failing.

## How to proceed

In your text editor, open `assignment.js`.

You'll see instructions on how to proceed.  Write code to make each function pass the test, using the provided links to learn about how to do so.

After making each change:

- Tab over to the browser with `COMMAND+TAB`
- Refresh the browser with `COMMAND+R`
- Scroll to the first failing test (in red) and use the information provided to help you figure out what's next

You will tab/refresh hundreds of times during this challenge.  Check your work after every small change :)

## Wrestle with it

You may encounter challenges that seem confusing, or impossible.  Don't fret - _that's the point_!!  This exercise is designed to challenge you.  Resist the urge to just copy/paste code from your classmates, but definitely ask for help and talk to your peers.

## What success looks like

When you are done, your page should look like this:

- All tests should be passing
- You'll see green check boxes next to the things that are done

## Stretch Goal

Want more?  There's a _whole nother test suite_ just waiting for you!

open bonus.html
```

Then look at `bonus.js` to see what to do.  You know the drill :)
